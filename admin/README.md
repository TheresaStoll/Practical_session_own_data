Here is some information about my data:

- various excel flat files (csv) consisting of about 50,000 entries 
- at the moment I have 8 different csv files with data from the years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017
-number of columns: 72 (year 2011), 72 (year 2012), 70 (year 2013), 70 (year 2014), 70 (year 2015), 61 (year 2016), 62 (year 2017)
-names of columns: country, state, county/zone, site name, location ID, site type, cleanup date, latitude, longitude, watershed ID, adults, children, people, pounds, miles, types of different marine debris found (the names of the columns differ in the excel files and sometimes even repeat themselves)
-number of rows: 6291 (year 2011), 5625 (year 2012), 5572 (year 2013), 6100 (year 2014), 5879 (year 2015), 9711 (year 2016), 12859 (year 2017)
- each entry is a marine debris survey undertaken by volunteers from all around the world who submitted their data to Ocean Conservancy which in turn gave access to this data to my research team
- as these excel files were completed by different volunteers from all over the world, they are not tidy at all, they lack consistency and much information is missing
